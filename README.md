Case | Sblogger
Sports enthusiast Steve Lavent plans to create his ownWeb site called Sblogger
that contains articles and commentary on the world of sports.
The site will have a news feed that is continually updated with the latest scores and stories.
Steve also writes his own column, sharing his sometimes-quirky insights on the world of sports.
He wants browsers to automatically load his latest columns when the home page is initially opened, 
and he wants older columns to be accessible from an archive residing on theWeb server.
To create Steve’s site, you will write a JavaScript application 
to retrieve data from Steve’sWeb server and then write that information directly to Steve’s home page using a technology known asAJAX.
